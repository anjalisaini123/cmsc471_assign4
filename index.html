                    <h1>What Influences the Length of Atlantic Storms?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The hurricanes and tropical storms of the Atlantic have varying lengths 
                        and occur at different times of the year. We wanted to find which factors 
                        from our data set impact the length of an Atlantic storm.

                        <br><br>

                        Exploration of our data set led us to find that the maximum wind speed
                        of the storm, the diameter of the storm, and the month in which the storm
                        occurred all have some influence over the length of Atlantic storms. 
                        The following visulizations will help to show their influence.

                        This visulization shows the relationship between the wind speed and the 
                        length of the storms. (more info will be added later)

                        The diameter of an area experiencing over 34 knots of wind and the length of the storm has 
                        a positive correlation. So, it seems that storms which affect a larger area tend to last longer.

                    <p>
                        The diameter of an area experiencing over 64 knots of wind and the length of the storm
                        also has a generally positive correlation, but not nearly as strong as the one above! 
                        <br><br>
                        This is likely because higher speed winds are harder to sustain for long periods of time. So, 
                        areas with over 64 knots of wind tend to not last as long as areas with over 34 knots of wind.
                        <br><br>
                        There is one outlier, hurricane Nadine in 2012. Nadine was an erratic category 1 
                        hurricane. So, it had lower wind speeds compared to other hurricanes. However,
                        Nadine was erratic in the sense that it continued to oscillate between weakening and strengthing 
                        it's wind speed based on it's location. This resulted in Nadine to become the 4th longest lived
                        hurricane in the Atlantic ocean.
                        <br><br>
                        Note that many storms do not even reach over 64 knots of wind speed. So, there respective diameters are 0.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, we still see that larger storms tend to last longer.

                        Here we have the relationship between the month in which the storms occur 
                        and their average duration in hours. 
                        <br><br>
                        Many storms occur in August and September, which lie near the end of Summer. Tropical storms form in warm,
                        low-pressure areas over the ocean. Because the ocean waters have been warmed throughout
                        the Summer season, the end-of-Summer months tend to be the most conducive for many strong, lengthy storms.
